# Conquer webpage

This project is a single webpage to demonstrates my use of html, jQuery, Sass, and css grids to build a responsive web page. 

# Getting started
- Clone repo: `git@github.com:JL-J/conquer-webpage.git`
- `cd conquer-webpage`
- I'm using the atom-live-server package to load this page. If you do not have this, then you may need to install a server.
